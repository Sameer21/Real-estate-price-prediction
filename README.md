This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting real estate prices based on features such as property area, location, and other relevant factors. The goal is to develop a reliable model that can estimate property prices to support buyers, sellers, and agents in making informed decisions.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real estate datasets

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression)

Evaluation and comparison of model performance

Interactive visualizations and insights

Notebook and script-based implementation for reproducibility

Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook
