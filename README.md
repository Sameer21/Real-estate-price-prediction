## Notebook Explanation

The main notebook `notebooks/price_prediction_model.ipynb` contains a step-by-step implementation of linear regression for real estate price prediction:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Visualization of the relationship between area and price
3. Linear regression model training
4. Price prediction for a new property
5. Visualization of the regression line
